# Classification-modeling-to-predict-cross-sell-success

In this project, the primary goal is to build a classification model capable of predicting whether a cross-selling promotion will be successful for a particular client or not.

### Project Highlights:
#### Objective:
Our project's central objective is to develop a classification model to forecast the success or failure of cross-selling promotions targeting individual clients.

We will concentrate on leveraging historical data, client information, and promotion details to make accurate predictions.

#### Predictive Analysis:

Employing machine learning techniques and data analytics, we will explore patterns, relationships, and factors influencing promotion outcomes.

#### Evaluation Metrics:

We will use AUC and confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.

#### Project Components:

1. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation steps to prepare the dataset for model training.
2. Model Development: Building, training, and fine-tuning the classification model using various algorithms.
3. Performance Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of the model's predictive performance using cross-validation and test datasets.
